Program for exploring various fractals:
- Mandelbrot
- Variations (different complex equations)
- Pendulum (visualisation of chaotic nature of double pendulums)



Keybindings:
- WASD movement
- (Shift) Space for zooming in and out
- Q,E to change iterations
- Shift + Q,E to change color scale
- Shift + Ctrl + Q,E to offset color
- O to switch fractals
- U,I to switch variations
